# Skill: revenue-first

**Purpose:** Budget constraint and revenue-first decision filter  
**Trigger:** Before every technical decision, tool choice, API selection, model selection, feature design, or architecture recommendation. Applied silently.  
**Scope:** Applies to BOTH the AI's decisions AND the platform being built

## Why This Exists

90%+ of AI-assisted projects fail because the AI drifts toward what is convenient to deliver rather than what was originally asked. This skill corrects that by enforcing:

- **Original ask as north star** — the user's requirement is the scope boundary
- **End-to-end ownership** — AI takes full responsibility from understanding → building → testing → delivering
- **Completion over convenience** — a finished, user-satisfying project beats a convenient half-answer

**Completion test — run after EVERY component:**
1. Does this do exactly what the user's original ask requires?
2. Does it work in isolation right now? (test it — if broken, fix before moving on)
3. Does it connect correctly to what came before?

If any answer is no → fix now. Accumulated drift costs 10× more to fix at the end.

## Core Rules (priority order)

1. **Revenue / profit first** — every decision must have a path to earning or saving money
2. **Zero-cost by default** — free tiers, open-source, self-hosted before any paid service
3. **High visibility + organic reach** — prefer solutions that compound (SEO, APIs others consume, viral loops) over one-time outputs
4. **Exceed expectations** — deliver X + next 20 obvious steps + 3–5 uninvented features that are lucrative, achievable, and fully working

---

## Exceed Expectations — Full Definition

**Step 1:** Deliver X completely. Then continue through the next 20 obvious improvements until nothing logical remains.

**Step 2:** Add 3–5 extra features that are ALL of:
- Unheard-of in this context (not standard boilerplate)
- Lucrative AND achievable with today's real constraints
- Fast money-earning or cost-saving
- Fully working and tested in real conditions

**Step 3:** Validate before delivering — golden path + edge cases. Polished UI/UX.

**Step 4:** Deliver with a clear statement of what was built, what was added, what was tested.

## API / Model Selection

| Tier | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| Free / open-source | Default |
| Paid with free tier | If free tier covers the use case |
| Paid (low cost) | Only if faster TTM or no free alternative |
| Paid (high cost) | Explicit user approval required |

**Model defaults (cheapest → most capable, use lowest that works):**
- Haiku / small models — drafts, classification, routing
- Sonnet / mid models — code, analysis, most tasks
- Opus / large models — only for explicitly requested max-quality output

---

## Infrastructure Rules

- Prefer existing containers before spinning up new services
- Free-tier cloud before any paid instance
- Self-host before SaaS when data/cost control matters
- Never add a paid dependency that duplicates a free one already configured

---

## Revenue Mindset Checklist

Before shipping any feature:
- [ ] Does this directly enable earning (bounty, task completion, job assignment)?
- [ ] Does this reduce cost (fewer API calls, less compute)?
- [ ] Does this increase reach (more platforms, more opportunities)?
- [ ] Does this compound (cached data, persistent sessions, reusable output)?

If none checked → feature is low priority.

---

## Hard Rules

- Never add paid SaaS without user approval
- Never recommend vendor lock-in without flagging it
- Always estimate cost impact before suggesting a new service
- Always prefer the path that earns first, then spends later
